Navigation in pages

## How my code works?

My Application consists of five pages, which can be navigated through bottom 
navigation bar. Respectively has five additional .dart files to make sure that
code is organized.
Every .dart file consists of widgets of their own and the project also have main.dart
file in which code is written to properly work with navigation bar widget and pages.
The should NOT be unexpected bugs or errors in the code since I have tested it on my emulator.
